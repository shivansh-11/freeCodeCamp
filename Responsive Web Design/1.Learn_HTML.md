# Learn HTML by Building A Cat Photo App

1. HTML elements have opening tags like ```<h1>``` and closing tags like ```</h1>```. The text an element will display goes between its opening and closing tags.

2. The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements.

Example Code:

```html
<h1>most important heading element</h1>
<h2>second most important heading element</h2>
<h3>third most important heading element</h3>
<h4>fourth most important heading element</h4>
<h5>fifth most important heading element</h5>
<h6>least important heading element</h6>
```
Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

3. The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites.

4. Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A comment in HTML starts with ```<!--```, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with ```-->```.

5. HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

The ```main``` element is used to represent the main content of the body of an HTML document. Content inside the ```main``` element should be unique to the document and should not be repeated in other parts of the document.

```html
<main>
  <h1>Most important content of the document</h1>
  <p>Some more important content...</p>
</main>
```
6. In the previous step, you put the h1, h2, comment, and p elements inside the main element. This is called nesting. Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in. This spacing is called ```indentation``` and it is used to make HTML easier to read.

7. You can add images to your website by using the ```img``` element. img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. An element without a closing tag is known as a void element.

8. HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The ```src``` attribute in an ```img``` element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located).

Here is an example of an ```img``` element with a ```src``` attribute pointing to the freeCodeCamp logo:

```html
<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_secondary.svg">
```
9. All ```img``` elements should have an ```alt``` attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

Here is an example of an ```img``` element with an ```alt``` attribute:

```html
<img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat">
```

10. You can link to another page with the anchor ```<a>``` element.

Example:
```html
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org"></a>
```
11. A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor ```<a>``` element.

Example:
```html
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org</a>
```

15. To open links in a new tab, you can use the ```target``` attribute on the anchor ```<a>``` element.

The ```target``` attribute specifies where to open the linked document. ```target="_blank"``` opens the linked document in a new tab or window.

Example:
```html
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>
```
17. In previous steps you used an anchor element to turn text into a link. Other types of content can also be turned into a link by wrapping it in anchor tags.

Here is an example of turning an image into a link:

```html
<a href="example-link">
  <img src="image-link.jpg" alt="A photo of a cat.">
</a>
```

18. Before adding any new content, you should make use of a ```section``` element to separate the cat photos content from the future content.

The ```section``` element is used to define sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document. It is a semantic element that helps with SEO and accessibility.

Example:
```html
<section>
  <h2>Section Title</h2>
  <p>Section content...</p>
</section>
```
21. When you add a lower rank heading element to the page, it's implied that you're starting a new subsection.

22. To create an unordered list of items, you can use the ```ul``` element.

23. The ```li``` element is used to create a list item in an ordered or unordered list.

Here is an example of list items in an unordered list:
```html
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>cheese</li>
</ul>
```

25. The ```figure``` element represents self-contained content and will allow you to associate an image with a caption.

26. A figure caption ```figcaption``` element is used to add a caption to describe the image contained within the figure element.

Here is an example of a ```figcaption``` element with the caption of A cute cat:

```html
<figure>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="A description of the image">
  <figcaption>A cute cat</figcaption>
</figure>
```
27. To place emphasis on a specific word or phrase, you can use the ```em``` element.

29. The code for an ordered list ```ol``` is similar to an unordered list, but list items in an ordered list are numbered when displayed.

34. The ```strong``` element is used to indicate that some text is of strong importance or urgent.

37. The form element is used to get information from a user like their name, email, and other details.

38. The ```action``` attribute indicates where form data should be sent.

Here is an example of a form element with an action attribute:
```html
<form action="/submit-url"></form>
```

39. The ```input``` element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. Like img elements, input elements are a void element and do not need closing tags.

40. There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the ```type``` attribute. You can easily create a password field, reset button, or a control to let users select a file from their computer.

41. In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the ```action``` attribute, you must give the text field a ```name``` attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted.

Here is an example of an ```<input>``` element with a ```name``` attribute:

```html
<input type="text" name="name">
```
42. Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an input.

Here is an example of an ```input``` element with a ```placeholder``` set to Ex. Jane Doe:

```html
<input type="text" placeholder="Ex. Jane Doe">
```

43. To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the ```required``` attribute to an ```input``` element. There's no need to set a value to the ```required``` attribute. Instead, just add the word ```required``` to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes.

44. The ```button``` element is used to create a clickable button.The default behavior of clicking a form button without any attributes submits the form to the location specified in the form's ```action``` attribute.

45. The ```button``` you added will submit the form by default. However, relying on default behavior may cause confusion. Add the ```type``` attribute with the value ```submit``` to the button to make it clear that it is a submit button.

```html
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
```

46. You can use radio buttons for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options.

Here is an example of a radio button with the text set as cat:
```html
<input type="radio"> cat
```

47. ```label``` elements are used to help associate the text for an ```input``` element with the ```input```element itself (especially for assistive technologies like screen readers).

Here is an example of a ```label``` element with a ```radio``` button:
```html
<label><input type="radio"> cat</label>
```
48. The ```id``` attribute is used to identify specific HTML elements. Each ```id``` attribute's value must be unique from all other id values for the entire page.

When elements have multiple attributes, the order of the attributes doesn't matter.

```html
<input id="email">
```

50. Notice that both radio buttons can be selected at the same time. To make it so selecting one radio button automatically deselects the other, both buttons must have a ```name``` attribute with the same value.

Here is an example of two radio buttons with the same name attribute:

```html
<input type="radio" name="meal"> Breakfast
<input type="radio" name="meal"> Lunch
```

51. If you select the Indoor radio button and submit the form, the form data for the button is based on its ```name``` and ```value``` attributes. Since your radio buttons do not have a ```value``` attribute, the form data will include ```indoor-outdoor=on```, which is not useful when you have multiple buttons.

Add a ```value``` attribute to both radio buttons. For convenience, set the button's value attribute to the same value as its id attribute.

```html
<label>
    <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor"> Indoor
</label>
<label>
    <input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor"> Outdoor
</label>
```

52. The ```fieldset``` element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. ```fieldset``` elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line.

53. The ```legend``` element acts as a caption for the content in the ```fieldset``` element. It gives users context about what they should enter into that part of the form.

56. Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer. The input element with a type attribute set to ```checkbox``` creates a checkbox.
```html
<input type="checkbox"> Reading
```
58. There's another way to associate an ```input``` element's text with the element itself. You can nest the text within a ```label``` element and add a ```for``` attribute with the same value as the ```input``` element's ```id`` attribute.

```html
<input id="breakfast" type="radio" name="meal" value="breakfast">
<label for="breakfast">Breakfast</label>
```

62. Like radio buttons, form data for selected checkboxes are ```name``` / ```value``` attribute pairs. While the ```value``` attribute is optional, it's best practice to include it with any checkboxes or radio buttons on the page.

63. In order to make a ```checkbox``` checked or radio button selected by default, you need to add the checked attribute to it.

Here is an example of a radio button with the checked attribute:
```html
<input checked type="radio" name="meal" value="breakfast"> Breakfast
```
64. The ```footer``` element is used to define a footer for a document or section. A footer typically contains information about the author of the document, copyright data, links to terms of use, contact information, and more.
```html
<footer>
    <p>No Copyright - freeCodeCamp.org</p>
</footer>
```

67. Notice that everything you've added to the page so far is inside the ```body``` element. All page content elements that should be rendered to the page go inside the ```body``` element. However, other important information goes inside the ```head``` element.

The ```head``` element is used to contain metadata about the document, such as its title, links to stylesheets, and scripts. Metadata is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the page.

68. The ```title``` element determines what browsers show in the title bar or tab for the page.

69. Notice that the entire contents of the page are nested within an ```html``` element. The ```html``` element is the root element of an HTML page and wraps all content on the page.

You can also specify the language of your page by adding the ```lang``` attribute to the ```html``` element.

```html
<html lang="en">
```
70. All pages should begin with ```<!DOCTYPE html>```. This special string is known as a declaration and ensures the browser tries to meet industry-wide specifications.

```<!DOCTYPE html>``` tells browsers that the document is an HTML5 document which is the latest version of HTML.

71. You can set browser behavior by adding ```meta``` elements in the ```head```. Inside the ```head``` element, nest a ```meta``` element with an attribute named ```charset```. Set to the value to ```utf-8``` which tells the browser how to encode characters for the page.

Note that the meta element is a ```void``` element.
```html
 <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>CatPhotoApp</title>
  </head>
```
